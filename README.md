Collaboration: discussed ideas with Stephanie Cleland
Hours committed: ~10
Summary: basic personal website for Comp20 HW1 at Tufts University,
		 Website includes an index page, a short bio page and a resume page
		 and will be hosted through GitHub

Implementation:
		all required features were successfully implemented. The photo on the
		index page was gratuituously added to meet the specifications.
		The website also 
		has external links to LinkedIn, Twitter and GitHub profiles as well 
		as an e-mail link. 
		page displays well when window is maximised, however the use of 'float'
		for the right side bar and 'cover' for the large background image 
		means that the page layout is disturbed when the window becomes too 
		small.
